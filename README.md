# [Research Report: D-Extract - Extracting dimensional attributes from product images](https://www.amazon.science/publications/d-extract-extracting-dimensional-attributes-from-product-images)



#### **Abstract**
The exponential growth of e-commerce has amplified the need for accurate product attribute extraction to streamline cataloging and enhance user experiences. This research focuses on D-Extract, a computational framework designed to extract dimensional attributes such as weight, height, and volume from product images using state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing techniques. The system integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR), text post-processing, and unit-matching algorithms to provide precise attribute estimations. The proposed methodology is evaluated for its accuracy, scalability, and applicability across diverse product categories.

#### **Introduction**
Dimensional attributes (e.g., weight, height, length) are essential for product descriptions in online platforms. However, extracting these values manually from product images is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automated systems, leveraging machine learning and computer vision, can streamline this process.

The research focuses on:
1. **OCR-Based Attribute Detection**: Extracting textual information from product labels.
2. **Dimensional Data Interpretation**: Identifying and mapping extracted values to meaningful units (e.g., kg, cm).
3. **System Scalability**: Ensuring robustness across diverse image qualities and product categories.

### **Need, Benefits, and Future Scope of D-Extract**

#### **Need**
- **E-Commerce**: Automating product dimension extraction reduces manual effort and errors.
- **Logistics**: Essential for efficient shipping, inventory, and warehouse management.
- **Customer Trust**: Accurate dimensions improve purchase confidence and reduce returns.
- **Automation Demand**: Supports scaling in cataloging and product data management.

#### **Benefits**
- **Time-Saving**: Automates attribute extraction, handling thousands of images efficiently.
- **Accuracy**: Reduces human errors with precise OCR and unit mapping.
- **Cost-Effective**: Cuts labor costs and return losses.
- **Scalability**: Works across diverse products and image types.
- **User Satisfaction**: Enhances transparency and shopping experience.

#### **Future Scope**
- **3D Analysis**: Adds depth sensing for 3D dimensions.
- **Multilingual Support**: Adapts to global markets with diverse languages.
- **AI Context Understanding**: Distinguishes ambiguous attributes (e.g., "10g" vs. "10m").
- **AR/VR Integration**: Visualizes dimensions in real-world environments.

#### **Methodology**

##### **1. Data Preprocessing**
Images are preprocessed to enhance text clarity:
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Reduces noise and enhances text visibility.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Improves OCR performance by isolating text regions.
- **Edge Detection**: Identifies label boundaries.

##### **2. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
The system integrates Tesseract and EasyOCR for text extraction:
- **Tesseract OCR**: Suitable for structured labels with consistent font styles.
- **EasyOCR**: Effective for unstructured or multilingual labels.

##### **3. Text Post-Processing**
Extracted text is cleaned using:
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Isolates numerical values and their associated units (e.g., "5kg", "10cm").
- **Noise Removal**: Eliminates irrelevant symbols and characters.

##### **4. Unit Mapping**
Dimensional units (e.g., "kg", "cm") are matched using a pre-defined unit dictionary:
- **Abbreviation Expansion**: Converts "kg" to "kilogram" and "cm" to "centimeter."
- **Entity-Specific Mapping**: Maps values to relevant dimensions based on the entity type (e.g., "item_weight").

##### **5. System Integration**
The system is built using Streamlit, a Python-based framework for creating interactive web applications. It supports:
- Image uploads.
- Dimensional attribute extraction.
- Real-time result display.
